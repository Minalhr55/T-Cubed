# T-Cubed -TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
Twitter sentiment analysis is a way of analysing a big pile of  tweets (train.csv) and generating a  model that detects negative, non negative tweets and classifies it accordingly with highest accuracy. 

This can be used in multiple real life situations, for example, to detect if a customer is happy or dissatisfied with a particular product, the impact of a famous celebrity on fans, to detect homophobic and racist insults or threats directed at people, and so on.

Word Clouds is also used to visualize the most frequent words or popular phrases appearing most frequently in the dataset.

Sentiment analysis is an NLP technique, where we perform feature generation, preprocessing etc to perform analysis on large amounts of natural language data. And taking it further, we train our pre-processed data under the classifier models- Logistic Regression and Na√Øve Bayes. Performance is evaluated and then, is taken forward for testing as a step to success! (test.csv).

The final model will be able to smoothly classify a bunch of tweets to finally meet up to our expectations.
